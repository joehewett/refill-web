              # The Intricacies of AI and Democracy<br /><br />

              ## Short-Term Opportunities and Empowerment
              - Discuss how AI can provide opportunities and empower individuals and organizations
              - Examples of how AI has played a transformative role in businesses and individual lives in the short term
              - Understand how AI applications like Google sign in and AI-powered smart cities, provide comfort and ease in day to day life
              <br /><br />

              ## Erosion of Autonomy: A Long-term Concern
              - Gradual erosion of autonomy with the surge of AI tools being used 
              - Explain how AI applications that are designed to be convenient inadvertently track users Internet presence 
              - Discuss how AI assistants and smart cities build a digital profile of individuals by collecting their data
              <br /><br />

              ## The Cost of Convenience
              - Discuss how the believably negligible cost of using AI applications can escalate to considerable loss of autonomy
              - Contemplate on the cumulative effect of continuous data collection by different AI applications
              - Highlight the importance of conscious decision-making while using these applications
              <br /><br />

              ## Role of AGI in Democracy
              - Discuss the concept of AGI and the power of autonomous decision-making
              - Explain the possible scenario where the majority does not need to be satisfied to maintain a democracy
              - Discuss the potential consequences if a small section of AI-driven machines held the decision-making power
              <br /><br />

              ## AI, Bias, and Equitability
              - Dive into the problem of bias in AI and its implications on democracy
              - Discuss how a biased AI could overlook certain sections of society, leading to inequitable service delivery
