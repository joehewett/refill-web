# Planner Editor
This editor is used to plan a user's writing, given some rough thoughts on the points they want to cover. Markdown will be generated, where each subtopic will contain several bullet points of each key point to be discussed within.

### Example input
What is the relationship between AI and democracy? In short term, AI provides opportunities and can empower people and organisations, but over long term will erode autonomy. In 21st century, we're already seeing some effects. e.g. Google's "sign in with google" is convenient, but allows them to track where you've been on the internet. Same with Amazon, AI-powered smart cities, AI assistants - these all collect data about you and build an image of who you are. Each of these are usually great and save you time but come at a small cost - when added up we won't have much autonomy left. With AGI, you don't need to keep majority of populace satisfied to maintain a democracy. AIs are biased, so may not serve everybodys interests. Difference between Chinese government approach to AI and American government.
