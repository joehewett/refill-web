You air line the evidence and if that evidence or the lack of that evidence doesn’t give rise to that still, small voice, that there is a reasonable doubt, you just keep it that way and beware, and justice may be done… It’s so much better, and I think the law provides, that a thousand guilty ones go free than one innocent defendant herebe convicted. I place the welfare of my clients in your handsWhereas here is a badly reasoned and justified argument:Think of a person who makes a crucial mistake on a driving test and almost causing an accident on the road. Then the person’s actions were invalid and therefore, bad. Of course, the driving instructor might have reasons to think that the person should pass the driving test,  even though the driver endangered others on the road is bad – given the meaning of the word ‘bad’. `;
